I'm Saketh and I work on Kubernetes operators [@gardener](https://github.com/gardener)!  

I'm interested in Go, Kubernetes, Rust, and infrastructure in general.

I currently maintain:

- [ai-dynamo/grove](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/grove), an operator for orchestrating AI inference workloads.
- [gardener/etcd-druid](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid), an operator for [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) clusters.
- [gardener/etcd-backup-restore](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore), a component that helps validate, backup and recover your etcd clusters.

Feel free to contact me via email at [contact-me@renormalize.dev](mailto:contact-me@renormalize.dev).
